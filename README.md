**This is a work in progress for [Assignment 3](#assignment-3)**

# Book Review Web Application

This project is part of the Software Architecture course at Universidad de los Andes, under the guidance of Professor Jos√© Luis Assadi. The aim of this assignment is to develop a basic book review web application.

## Project Overview

The Book Review Web Application is designed to manage and display information related to books, authors, reviews, and sales. The application meets the following requirements:

- **Authors Management**: Allows the creation, updating, deletion, and viewing of authors, including their name, date of birth, country of origin, and a brief description.
- **Books Management**: Supports the management of books, including their name, summary, publication date, and sales data.
- **Reviews Management**: Enables users to submit reviews for books, including a score (from 1 to 5), review content, and the number of up-votes received.
- **Sales Management**: Tracks book sales by year, including the total sales figures.

## Application Features

The application provides the following views and functionalities:

- **CRUD Operations**: Full Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for authors, books, reviews, sales.
- **Author Statistics Table**: A sortable and filterable table displaying authors, the number of books published, average review scores, and total sales.
- **Top Rated Books Table**: A table showing the top 10 highest-rated books of all time, along with their most popular highest and lowest-rated reviews.
- **Top Selling Books Table**: A table listing the top 50 best-selling books of all time, including total sales for each book, total sales for the author, and information on whether the book was among the top 5 best-selling books in the year of its publication.
- **Search Functionality**: A search window that allows users to input text and receive a paginated list of books whose descriptions contain any of the entered words.

## Assignment 3
### **WIP**

For this assignment we will use:

- [Redis](https://redis.io/) for our database cache.
- Some search aplication TBD
- [HAProxy](https://www.haproxy.org/) for our Reverse Proxy

### We have to set up the following:
You must implement multiple docker compose files that account for
the following deployments:
- Application + Database
- Application + Database + Cache
- Application + Database + Search Engine
- Application + Database + Reverse Proxy
- Application + Database + Reverse Proxy + Cache + Search Engine
